# Experimental features

Features gated behind `AppSettingsController::experimentalFeaturesEnabled`
(Settings → Experimental features), off by default. See that property's own
doc comment and `ActionCard.qml`'s `experimental` property for how the gate
works, and the `DJCONVERT_EXPERIMENTAL` CMake option for the build-time
opt-in-mechanism switch.

New non-trivial features default to this list. Move an entry to "Graduated
to stable" (and drop `experimental: true` from its `ActionCard`) once it's
seen real, successful use — most importantly, an actual write/apply path
exercised live against real hardware, not just a read-only scan.

## Currently experimental

(none yet)

## Graduated to stable

- **Library Health** (added 2026-08-29, graduated 2026-08-30) —
  cross-catalog consistency scan/repair, plus the 0:00-junk-memory-cue
  cleanup.

- **Stick Statistics** (added 2026-08-29, graduated 2026-08-30) —
  filesystem/hardware info, per-catalog library stats, a Filelight-style
  disk usage breakdown, and a local read-speed benchmark with history.
