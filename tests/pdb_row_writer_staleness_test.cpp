// PdbRowWriter's staleness guard, against the one case that twice defeated
// weaker versions of it: an external rewrite of the .pdb, in the SAME
// process, at IDENTICAL length.
//
// Why that case specifically, and why a dedicated test rather than another
// case inside pdb_row_writer_test.cpp: the guard has now shipped broken
// twice, and both times the whole existing suite stayed green.
//
//   - A size/mtime-only guard is blind here by construction. The length is
//     unchanged so file_size() can't move, and on Windows an in-process
//     path-based fs::last_write_time() genuinely does not observe a write
//     that just happened (confirmed empirically on Windows 11/NTFS: the
//     directory entry is refreshed on handle close/reopen, so a separate
//     *process* sees the new timestamp while the writing process does
//     not). Both halves of the cheap pre-filter miss it at once.
//   - A `PRAGMA data_version` guard (tried on the OneLibrary side, which
//     adapted this class's convention) is blind for an unrelated reason:
//     data_version is a per-connection counter that only moves when *that
//     same connection* observes another connection's commit, so a
//     guard that opens a fresh connection per check reads the same value
//     forever.
//
// What survives both is comparing the file's actual bytes, which is what
// PdbRowWriter::commit() now does via a whole-file CRC32. This test exists
// so a regression back to metadata-only staleness detection fails here
// instead of silently reaching a user's real export.pdb.
//
// SEABASS_SOURCE_DIR is injected by CMakeLists.txt (CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR) so
// the fixture resolves regardless of the build directory's location --
// same convention as anonymized_fixture_integration_test.cpp.
