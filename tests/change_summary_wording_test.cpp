// someone who had just deleted something and wanted to know what.
//
// The summary reads "<n> of <m> <unit> <verb>.", so unit and verb have
// to make an English sentence together rather than each being
// defensible alone. These build the real change objects and ask them,
// rather than restating a table the code could disagree with.
