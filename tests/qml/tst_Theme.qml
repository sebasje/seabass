// A regression guard for a real gotcha hit setting this test module up:
// Theme.qml's QT_QML_SINGLETON_TYPE source property has to be set BEFORE
// qt_add_qml_module() registers it (see CMakeLists.txt's own comment on
// the exact ordering) -- get that backwards and Theme.qml compiles as a
// plain, non-singleton type instead. Every bare `Theme.xxx` reference
// elsewhere then silently evaluates to undefined (no error at all,
// nothing to grep for) rather than the QML engine complaining that
// "Theme" isn't defined, which took real effort to track down the first
// time. This test would have caught it in under a second.
