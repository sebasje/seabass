// The mechanism has to differ by platform, because what stops a delete
// differs. On POSIX, removing a name is a write to the parent directory,
// so clearing that directory's write bit is enough -- and holding the
// file open would not help, since unlink() happily removes an open file.
// On Windows the opposite holds: a directory's permissions do not gate
// deleting the files inside it (and std::filesystem::permissions there
// only reaches the read-only attribute anyway, which fs::remove is free
// to clear), while a handle opened without FILE_SHARE_DELETE does block
// it. That is also the case this code path exists to survive in the
// first place -- a track still held open by rekordbox or a player.
