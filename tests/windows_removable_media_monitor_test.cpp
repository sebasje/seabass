// every one of their destructors -- including this monitor's stop() --
// runs on the Qt main thread during app shutdown: closing the app could
// sit unresponsive for up to ~2s per monitor. Fixed with a condition
// variable stop() can wake immediately; this pins that down so it can't
// silently regress back to the blocking poll.
