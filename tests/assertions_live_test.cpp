// The suite is built out of assert(): 2100-odd of them across nearly
// every test file, none guarded. Three of CMake's four standard build
// types put -DNDEBUG in CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_<CONFIG>, which turns all of
// them into no-ops -- the suite then passes without checking anything,
// and passes faster, so nothing looks wrong.
//
// CMakeLists.txt adds -UNDEBUG to every test target to stop that. This
// file is the proof that it works, rather than the belief that it does:
// if the flag ever stops reaching a test target, this one fails to
// compile and says why, instead of the whole suite quietly going hollow.
//
// Compile-time rather than runtime on purpose. A runtime check would
// have to assert something false and catch the abort, which is exactly
// the behaviour under test -- so it would pass either way in a build
// where assertions are dead.
