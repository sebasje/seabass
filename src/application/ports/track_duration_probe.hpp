// Port for reading a track's playing length straight from the audio
// file, for the (common) case where neither catalog recorded one.
//
// This exists because Engine leaves `Track.length` NULL until it has
// analyzed a track -- 77.6% of rows on a real 1564-track stick -- and
// length is the only field that can tell a radio edit from an extended
// mix of the same artist+title. Without it DuplicateTrackFinder cannot
// safely group anything, so Clean Up finds almost nothing (31 groups
// instead of 235 on that stick).
//
// Kept as a port specifically so seabass_core stays Qt-free: the only
// implementation that reads real audio is QtMultimediaDurationProbe,
// which lives in its own target and links Qt. The CLI and the GUI both
// get it when Qt is present; NullTrackDurationProbe stands in when it
// is not, and callers must behave correctly (just less usefully) with
// that.

    // file is a normal thing to meet on a real stick.
