// library: rekordbox and Engine rows carry fileSizeBytes = 0 -- neither
// format records a file's size -- so every space figure computed from
// them was structurally zero however much audio was really duplicated,
// and only OneLibrary produced a number at all. That is why the same
// stick reported "0 GB" from two catalogs and "6.35 GB" from the third.
//
// So the sizes are read from the filesystem, which is also the only
// thing that can be right: a catalog row is a claim about a file, and
// the file is what gets deleted.

// shows -- per group, per row, and the totals -- is derived from that
// field, so correcting it once makes all of them true rather than adding
// a second, parallel notion of size that could disagree.
//
// Deliberately called AFTER planning, not before. The planner compares
// bitrate and file size to choose a survivor, and feeding it different
// numbers would change which copy is kept -- a real improvement, since
// two of the three catalogs report zero, but a different change from
// this one and not one to make silently.
//
// Skips held-back strays (the planner refuses to delete them, so their
// bytes are not on offer) and any copy sharing the survivor's path.
// Each distinct path is stat'd once however many plans name it.
