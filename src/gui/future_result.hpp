// QtConcurrent stores an exception thrown inside a run() body and
// rethrows it from QFutureWatcher::result(). That call happens in a slot
// on the GUI thread, where nothing catches it: Qt wraps it as
// QUnhandledException and the process calls std::terminate. A stick
// pulled mid-walk, an unreadable archive -- any std::filesystem_error on
// the background side -- therefore killed the whole app instead of
// showing an error (confirmed from a real crash dump: BackupStick::
// preview() threw, StickBackupController::onPreviewFinished() rethrew,
// terminate).
//
// On a throw this hands back a default-constructed result -- every
// caller already tolerates the "no result" case -- and puts the message
// in `error` for the controller to surface however it normally does.
