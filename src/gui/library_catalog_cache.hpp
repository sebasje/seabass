// Caches the result of scanning a catalog (rekordbox/engine/onelibrary),
// keyed on (format, path), so the many controllers that each independently
// call ScanLibrary today (8 controllers, 26 call sites at the time this was
// written) can share one real disk read per catalog per session instead of
// re-scanning the same removable-media data on every page open.
//
// Lives in gui/, not domain/application: constructing the right
// infrastructure reader for a given format string is exactly the job every
// controller's own scan-task function already does (see e.g.
// SyncController::runAnalyzeTask), just consolidated here instead of
// duplicated per controller.
//
// tracksFor() is blocking -- call it from whatever background thread
// (QtConcurrent::run task) used to call ScanLibrary directly, same as
// before. It is safe to call concurrently from multiple threads for
// different (or the same) keys: a second caller for a key another thread
// is already scanning waits for that scan to finish rather than triggering
// a redundant one.
//
// Freshness is checked by comparing the catalog's own database file's
// mtime against what was cached; a write elsewhere (Sync's apply(), Clean
// Up, ...) should call invalidate() explicitly right after, rather than
// relying purely on the next mtime check, so a caller never has to wait
// out a filesystem timestamp granularity window to see its own write.
//
// progress is only ever touched on a cache miss (a hit returns instantly,
// nothing to report) -- passed in per-call rather than held as cache
// state, so the cache itself stays agnostic to which controller's
// progress properties a given caller wants updated. Callers that don't
// care (StickStatisticsController's own scan reports no progress today
// either) can omit it and get NullProgressReporter.
