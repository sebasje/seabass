// which backup in the backup folder it relates to and what to offer
// (update it, restore it, back up fresh), and which *other* mounted
// stick or backup holds a copy of the same library to create this stick
// from or bring it up to date from. Decided by
// application::adviseStickBackup from the library's content fingerprint,
// the stick's hardware identifier, its label and its catalog mtime.
//
// The facts about a stick (fingerprints, mtime, sizes) are gathered on a
// worker thread, one stick at a time, and kept; the advice itself is
// pure and cheap, so it is recomputed for every known stick whenever any
// stick's facts change -- stick B's advice depends on stick A being
// there.
