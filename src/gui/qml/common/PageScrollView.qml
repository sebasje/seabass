// The scrollable container every full-page form uses (padding, the big
// scroll bar, content as wide as the view), with two rules on top: it is
// only draggable/flickable when its content actually overflows (a page
// that fits was still grabbable and would slide around under the mouse
// with nowhere to go), and BigScrollBar is paired with a plain Flickable
// rather than a Control-styled ScrollView.
//
// The Flickable choice isn't cosmetic -- see StickStatisticsPage.qml's and
// SyncPage.qml's own comments on the same fix. A platform style (KDE's
// org.kde.desktop on Linux; FluentWinUI3 on Windows, which has no
// ScrollView.qml of its own and falls back to Basic's) knows how to
// position a ScrollView's *own* default scrollbar, but doesn't know how
// to place a foreign BigScrollBar assigned over it -- it rendered
// unanchored, cramped in a corner instead of docked to the right edge and
// spanning the full height. Every other scrollable page in this app
// already avoids ScrollView for exactly this reason; this file used to be
// the one holdout, and the Full Stick Backup / Restore pages (which use
// it) were where the bug showed.

    // check -- without it, a page sized to the exact pixel flickers
    // between interactive and not.

    // The scroll bar is an overlay: it is drawn on top of the content
    // rather than taking width from it, so without reserving room the
    // rightmost pixels of every page sit underneath it. Invisible on a
    // label, glaring on a right-aligned button, whose text ends up
    // half under the bar -- which is how this was noticed.
    //
    // Reserved unconditionally rather than only while the bar is shown.
    // Making it conditional reads better and does not work: the width
    // would depend on `interactive`, which depends on contentHeight,
    // which depends on the children's height, which depends on the
    // width. That is a binding loop, and QML resolves those by picking
    // an answer rather than by complaining.
