// Shown in place of the (invisible) waveform cue markers when a track's
// duration is unknown -- Engine never analyzed it (no waveform/beatgrid
// data computed, typically because cues were set live on hardware and
// the track was never run through Engine's offline analysis), so
// WaveformView has nothing to position cue markers against and silently
// draws none, even though the cues genuinely exist and may differ from
// another copy's -- confirmed against real duplicate-conflict data where
// both copies had real, differing hot-cue data but null duration/
// waveform/beatgrid fields.
