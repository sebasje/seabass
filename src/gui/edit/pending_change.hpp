// and checks for cancellation only *between* them, so every change is
// either fully on the stick or still pending, never half-written.
//
// apply() runs on a worker thread with no access to any controller or
// model: everything a change needs travels in by value at construction
// (same rule as every background task in src/gui). Per-save resources
// (backups, the operation log, per-format writers and scratch copies)
