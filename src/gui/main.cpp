// Qt Quick Controls' Material style resolves its palette from these
// environment variables exactly once, the first time a Material-styled
// item is instantiated -- and that includes every Popup-based control
// (Dialog, ComboBox's dropdown, Menu, ToolTip), which does NOT reliably
// inherit Material.theme/accent/etc set as QML attached properties on the
// ApplicationWindow (Popups attach to the window's overlay, not its item
// tree, so that inheritance chain doesn't reach them). Setting the style
// globally here, before QGuiApplication exists, is what actually makes
// every Material-styled surface in the app -- not just the ones directly
// under the window -- consistently follow either "Kelp" (this app's own
// always-dark palette) or the system's own light/dark choice.
//
// Deliberately only sets THEME + ACCENT/PRIMARY, not BACKGROUND/
// FOREGROUND -- overriding those too caused widespread dark-on-dark and
// light-on-light contrast bugs (disabled-state colors, hint text, row
// alternation and more all broke at once), because Material's style
// implementation derives several other colors *from* its own default
// background/foreground relationship, not just from the two colors
// directly. Standard Material Dark's own background/foreground are close
// enough to "Kelp" for Popups (the only place this env var actually
// matters -- everything else uses Theme.qml's exact palette directly),
// and staying internally consistent matters far more there than an exact
// color match.
//
// Must run before the QGuiApplication is constructed -- Qt Quick
// Controls reads these at first use, effectively at process startup.
// Returns the useSystemTheme setting it read, so main() can reuse it
// without opening QSettings a second time.

    // (breeze's ProgressBar.qml assumes an anchoring context Material's
