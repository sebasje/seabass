// every format actually shares). This adapts the latter to the former,
// using a sourceId->filePath map built from the tracks actually being
// written -- see DuplicatesController's own use of this for why no
// track REMOVAL is involved here (this only ever backs the non-
// destructive "copy cues" flow; Clean Up Duplicates' destructive removal
// doesn't support OneLibrary as a primary target yet, since
// OneLibraryCueWriter::removeTrackByPath() deletes playlist-membership
// rows outright rather than reassigning them to a survivor the way
// application::LibraryCleanupWriter::removeTrackReplacingWith()
// requires -- see cleanup_controller.cpp's own comment).
