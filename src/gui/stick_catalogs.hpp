    // failed read means "this stick HAS one and we do not know what it
    // protects". A caller about to delete files must refuse on a
    // non-empty list rather than proceed with partial knowledge.

// Reads every catalog present on the stick that `libraryPath` belongs
// to -- rekordbox, Engine and OneLibrary alike -- regardless of which
// one the caller happens to be working in.
//
// `libraryPath` is a catalog directory (".../PIONEER", ".../Engine
// Library"); the stick root is its parent. Reads go through
// LibraryCatalogCache, so a catalog already scanned this session costs
// nothing.
//
// This exists because "is this file still needed?" is a question about
// the stick, never about one catalog.
//
// Note that the three are not three separate libraries: OneLibrary
// (exportLibrary.db, "Device Library Plus") is the same rekordbox
// library as export.pdb in a newer format, so their track lists overlap
// heavily rather than adding up. That makes the single-catalog check
// worse, not better -- the two rekordbox formats do not agree on
// contents. Measured on RV2, where 1468 files on disk are referenced by
// something:
//
//   consulting only rekordbox   protects 1161 -> 307 referenced files
//                                                would look deletable
//   consulting only OneLibrary  protects 1451 ->  17
//   consulting only Engine      protects 1468 ->   0
//
// Those 307 are files the DJ can still play, that a cleanup run from the
// rekordbox side would have permanently destroyed. Engine happens to be
// a superset on this one stick; nothing guarantees that on the next.
