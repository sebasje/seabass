// there easily. Identity elsewhere.
//
// The prefix has to be applied per call, not once at the top of an
// operation: it does not survive a path being taken apart and rebuilt,
// and a std::filesystem call handed the unprefixed path does not fail
// loudly. fs::remove() past MAX_PATH returns false with its error_code
// set to *success*, which is indistinguishable from "it was already
// gone" -- see RestoreStickBackup::writeEntry for what that cost.

// std::filesystem::directory_iterator cannot be used for this on Windows.
// Handed a \\?\ path it does not fail -- it silently enumerates the
// process's current working directory instead, reporting success. Every
// name it then yields is a real file that is not in the directory that
// was asked about, joined onto the path that was asked about, so the
// results look plausible and are entirely wrong. Verified side by side:
// FindFirstFileW on exactly the same \\?\ pattern returns the directory's
// two real files, while directory_iterator returns 155 entries from the
// build tree the test happened to be run from.
//
// That single defect is what made two separate bugs possible: the stick
// walker could not descend past MAX_PATH (so backups silently omitted
// whole subtrees while still reporting Complete), and fs::remove_all
// spins forever on such a tree instead of reporting that it is stuck.
