// Stores backups under baseDirectory, one directory per backup:
// baseDirectory/<timestamp>-<label>/, each holding a single deflated
// `backup.zip` plus its manifest.
//
// One archive rather than loose copies, for two measured reasons. The
// loose layout cost one durable whole-file write per file -- about 118 ms
// each on Linux and 15 ms on Windows, against roughly 2 s for the same
// bytes as one file -- and it was permanent: 400 loose analysis files
// occupy 71.5 MB against 45.5 MB deflated, on sticks that were 95% and
// 97% full. See docs/write-path-performance.md.
//
// A user can still get a file back by hand without Seabass: a zip opens
// in every file manager, and the entry names carry the whole relative
// path, so 200 files all called ANLZ0000.EXT are told apart by where they
// came from rather than by a _1/_2 suffix the loose layout needed.
