// What an anonymized export is allowed to contain, in one place, because
// two pieces of code have to agree about it: the anonymizer decides what
// to copy out of a real stick, and the verifier refuses the export if it
// finds anything else. When those two lists were written separately, a
// real stick carrying a file neither of them knew about (playlists3.sync,
// playlists3Plus.sync, RBFLTR.DAT) produced an export that the verifier
// then refused -- correct, but it made the feature unusable rather than
// dropping the file.
//
// The rule is an allowlist rather than a list of things to remove. A
// rekordbox version that adds a new side file must not be able to leak
// it, and must not be able to block an export either: anything not named
// here is dropped by the anonymizer before the verifier ever sees it.

// RBFLTR.DAT        the saved browse filters -- carries My Tag and
//                   genre selections, no anonymizer
// *-shm, *-wal      SQLite side files, unscrubbed by definition
