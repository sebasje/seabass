// `libraryPath` is any catalog directory on the stick (".../PIONEER",
// ".../Engine Library"); the stick root is its parent, so this answers
// "given one catalog, where are the others".
//
// Removing a duplicate *file* means removing its row from every catalog
// that lists it, and a caller holding one catalog's path needs the rest
// to do that. Deriving them at each call site would scatter the
// PIONEER/"Engine Library" layout knowledge; it lives here instead.
//
// Existence is checked rather than assumed. "rekordbox" and
// "onelibrary" share the PIONEER directory but are different files
// inside it (export.pdb, exportLibrary.db) and a stick can carry either
// without the other -- returning a path for a catalog that is not there
// would send a writer at a file it would have to create.
