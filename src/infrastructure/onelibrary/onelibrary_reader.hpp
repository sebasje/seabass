// Reads tracks (with cues and playlists) out of Rekordbox's "OneLibrary" /
// "Device Library Plus" format (exportLibrary.db), the third catalog a
// stick can carry alongside the classic Device Library (export.pdb) and
// Engine (m.db) -- see docs/onelibrary-format.md for the schema this is
// based on.
//
// Read-only. Tracks it returns carry format "onelibrary", and the
// write-oriented controllers now understand it: Sync runs the same
// diff+direction logic against it as against rekordbox/Engine, and Clean
// Up, Local Cue Backup, Add Cue and duplicate matching all have a
// OneLibrary path (via OneLibraryCueWriterAdapter, gated on
// OneLibraryCueWriter::existsFor()).
//
// This comment used to say the opposite -- that those four had no path
// for a third format and callers must keep these tracks out of those
// flows. That stopped being true as each one gained a path, and a stale
// capability note is worse than none: it argues for excluding data that
// is now handled correctly.
//
// What is still missing is listed in docs/onelibrary-format.md; the
// short version is that nothing can *create* a row here (see the
// export.pdb row-insertion issue for the same gap on the other side),
// hot loops are refused because the cue table has never been confirmed
// to round-trip them, and colorTableIndex has no known mapping.
