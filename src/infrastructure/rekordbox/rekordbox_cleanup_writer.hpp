// playlist, dropping the entry where it is, so no playlist silently
// loses the song and none end up with a duplicate), then removes the
// doomed track row itself, all in one PdbRowWriter session committed
// atomically. The caller (cli:: or gui::) is responsible for backing
// up export.pdb before constructing this -- this class only performs
// the write itself.
