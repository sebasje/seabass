// Windows auto-assigns a drive letter to a removable volume as soon as
// it's inserted -- so every stick this reports is, in Windows terms,
// already "mounted." mounted is still always true and mountPoint always
// set for that reason; devicePath holds the drive letter itself (e.g.
// "D:\\") since Windows has no /dev-style device node to report instead.
