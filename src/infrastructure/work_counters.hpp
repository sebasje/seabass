// How many times the expensive-per-item operations actually happened.
//
// Every performance problem this project has found in its own write paths
// had the same shape: something that should happen once per save happening
// once per item instead. Wall-clock cannot catch that in a test, because
// timing is a property of the medium -- the same Engine write costs 151 ms
// on a USB stick and 0.8 ms on a ramdisk (docs/write-path-performance.md).
// A count is the same number on every machine, on every platform, in a
// fraction of a second.
//
// So these are the portable half of performance testing: a test drives a
// realistic batch of work and asserts how many database opens and file
// parses it took. Cheap enough to leave compiled in always (four relaxed
// atomic increments on paths that are already doing disk I/O), which
// matters because a counter behind a build flag is a counter nobody reads.
