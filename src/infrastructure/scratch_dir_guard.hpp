// RAII cleanup for a scratch directory holding a temporary local copy of
// a file that's slow to access on its real (often removable) media --
// see e.g. EngineLibraryCreator::create() and sync_controller.cpp's own
// whole-file-replace path for why this pattern exists.
//
// Move-only, deliberately: a user-declared destructor suppresses the
// implicit move constructor, so a copyable version of this type is a
// real correctness hazard, not just style -- if it were copyable,
// std::optional<ScratchDirGuard>::emplace(ScratchDirGuard{path}) would
// silently fall back to COPYING the temporary argument into place, and
// that temporary's destructor (running at the end of the full
// expression, i.e. almost immediately) would delete the real scratch
// directory within microseconds of creating it -- before whatever just
// copied a file into it ever gets to use it. This was confirmed as the
// actual root cause of a real, reproducible sync failure ("exportLibrary
// .db does not exist" on every attempt) once three separate hand-rolled
// copies of this same struct existed and one of them was constructed via
// exactly that emplace-with-a-temporary pattern. Keep this move-only.
