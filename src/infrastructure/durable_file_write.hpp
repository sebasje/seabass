// the tested primitive above is simpler than a second streaming-copy
// implementation, and these files (library metadata, not embedded
// audio) are small enough that holding the whole thing in memory isn't
// a concern. Returns false, leaving targetPath untouched, if sourcePath
// can't be read.

// no equivalent gap). Exposed for callers that do their own rename -- the
// stick backup's compaction replaces a multi-GB archive by rename and
// cannot go through writeFileDurablyAtomic()'s in-memory buffer.
