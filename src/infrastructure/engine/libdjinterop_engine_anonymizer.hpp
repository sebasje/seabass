// has, since this is SQLite), every hot cue's/loop's label (the
// Engine-side equivalent of a rekordbox cue comment -- real free text a
// DJ typed per cue point, not just position/color), and every
// playlist/folder's name (whole tree, via root_playlists()/children()).

// database::remove_track() -- the same real, tested primitive
// LibdjinteropEngineCleanupWriter already relies on -- after first
// removing each doomed track from every playlist's track list it
// appears in (no survivor to repoint to, unlike that class's
// consolidation use case). Otherwise every real track is kept.
