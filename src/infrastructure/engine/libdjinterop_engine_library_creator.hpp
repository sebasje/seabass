// hardware can be fixed by trying another generation instead of needing

// Creates a brand-new Engine Library database from scratch (via
// djinterop::engine::create_database()) and populates it from an
// already-scanned track list, typically read from a rekordbox export on
// the same stick. This is the first feature in this codebase that
// fabricates an entire new database + directory structure rather than
// modifying an existing, already-recognized one -- see
// docs/experimental-features.md for why it's gated as experimental.
//
// Deliberately narrow for this first version. Carried over: title,
// artist, BPM, key (parsed via rekordbox_key_parser.hpp), duration,
// bitrate, rating, comment, file size, hot + memory cues (the same cue
// conversion LibdjinteropEngineCueWriter uses, applied directly to each
// track's own snapshot before it's created -- see the .cpp's own comment
// for why that matters for a bulk import specifically), and a *simple*,
// approximate two-point beatgrid computed from BPM and duration alone
// (assumes the track starts exactly on a downbeat at sample 0 -- not
// always true, but a reasonable approximation absent a real per-beat
// grid read from rekordbox's own analysis data, which this project
// doesn't parse yet despite the underlying Kaitai spec already defining
// that section).
//
// Deliberately NOT carried over in this version: album art (libdjinterop's
// own album_art API is unfinished -- see its header, marked "TODO -
// implement rest of album_art class" -- and track_snapshot has no
// artwork field at all), a real per-beat grid, waveform data (reading
// rekordbox's own waveform preview already works elsewhere in this
// project, but no rekordbox->Engine waveform format conversion exists
// yet), and playlists.

    // real size takes long enough that silently doing nothing visible looks
    // indistinguishable from a genuine hang. Defaults to NullProgressReporter
    // for callers (tests) that don't care.
