// The one place in the app that permanently destroys real audio file

// already have run through resolvePendingDeletions() against a *fresh*
// scan -- this function does no re-verification of its own, and trusts
// its input completely), deletes the file at entry.filePath from disk
// (or, if it's already gone, treats that as done rather than an error),
// then clears every successfully-processed entry from `manifest` in one
// rewrite. Entries that fail to delete stay in the manifest so a later
// pass can retry them.
//
// `cancel` is checked before every file: once it fires, the remaining
// entries are neither deleted nor cleared from the manifest, and the
// returned outcomes hold only the files reached (the caller reads the
// token to tell a cancelled run from a short one). `onFileProcessed`
// (optional) is called after each file with the running count.
