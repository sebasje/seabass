// Serves a browsed stick backup's analysis files straight out of the
// archive: one findEntry() plus one read (inflating if the entry was
// deflated), no extraction. See rekordbox::AnlzByteSource for why ANLZ is
// worth reading this way when the databases are not -- it is ~99% of a
// library's metadata bytes and is wanted one track at a time.
//
// Owns both the Zip64Reader and the ArchiveFile it reads through.
// Zip64Reader keeps only a raw `const ArchiveFile *`, so whoever holds a
// reader must outlive the file or the next entry read is a dangling
// pointer -- taking a share of the file here is what makes this source
// safe to hand to a reader and forget about. The reader has already
// validated every offset and count against the file size, so lookups are
// arithmetic on an already-checked central directory.
//
// One instance is shared by every thread that reads the same backup (see
// anlzSourceForPioneerRoot's cache): a scan on a worker and a waveform
// lookup on the UI thread can ask for entries at once. Zip64Reader fills
// its data-offset table lazily from a const method with no lock of its
// own, so read() serializes on m_readMutex -- every access to the reader
// goes through here.
