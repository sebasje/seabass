// Run before anything else touches an archive. Applies the rule from
// docs/stick-backup-plan.md: a present journal means an update did not
// confirm, but it must not blindly truncate -- the crash may have landed
// after the new trailer was durable and before the journal's clear was.
// So: if the archive parses at its current length, every entry written
// beyond the journaled pre-update length verifies and the manifest is
// intact, the update is complete and only the journal is cleared;
// otherwise the archive is truncated back and the old end-of-central-
// directory record is checked for being where the journal said.
//
// After a successful return the archive either parses, or is empty (a
// rolled-back first backup -- the caller removes the file). Throws
// ArchiveFormatError if neither state can be reached, which means the
// bytes before the journaled length were damaged too and the backup
// needs a human.
