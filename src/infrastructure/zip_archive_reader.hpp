// Exists so a data set can be kept and moved as one file instead of six
// thousand, and still be read by the corpus runner. The two from-scratch
// parsers in the test suite are deliberately not this function: they exist
// to check the writer's output without trusting any of our own reading
// code, so they stay independent.
