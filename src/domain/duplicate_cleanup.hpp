    // two different DJ applications, and including them made this flag
    // fire on 36 groups where 2 was the honest number. A group where only the survivor has a value
    // (nothing to lose) or every copy already agrees is NOT flagged --
    // this is specifically "real, differing, unpreservable data is
    // about to be discarded", not "some copy has more metadata than
    // another". Callers should default a group like this to *excluded*

    // The unreferenced files (Track::isUnreferenced) among `toRemove`,

    // survivor -- but the two kinds of copy are removed by entirely
    // different acts: a catalogued copy loses a database row and its
    // file stays, while a stray file has no row to drop, so removing it
    // means deleting the file. That is irreversible and no catalog will
    // ever mention the file again, so it is accounted for here rather
    // than left for each caller to infer from a flag on a Track.
    //
    // A stray is held back when the group is flagged `differs` (the
    // copies may be different edits, so the file may not be a duplicate
    // at all) or when any copy in the group had an estimated duration
    // (see Track::durationIsEstimated: the grouping itself is then in
    // doubt, which is a stronger reason than the one file's own length
    // being uncertain -- a wrongly grouped estimate could equally make
    // the *other* copies look redundant).
    //
    // `hasUnpreservableDataAtRisk` deliberately does NOT hold these
    // back, and that is a decision rather than an oversight. It protects
    // a rating or comment that only one copy carries; a stray file has
    // no row and so carries neither, and can only ever be caught by the
    // flag because two *catalogued* rows in its group disagree with each
    // other. Deleting the file loses none of the data the flag exists to
    // protect. On a real 3-catalog stick the coupling held back 2 of 632
    // stray files over a disagreement neither was party to -- and 57 of
    // them before play counts stopped counting as data at risk, which is
    // the shape of the mistake rather than its current size. Callers
    // still default such a group to excluded for the row-level cleanup,
    // exactly as before.
