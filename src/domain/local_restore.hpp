// and a local cue backup are worth restoring, and what merging them would
// actually produce. Restoring only ever writes to the stick (never back to
// the local backup), and never overwrites a cue already on the stick --
// only ever adds ones the stick is missing:
//   - Hot cues are keyed by slot number (1-8): a local hot cue is added
//     only if the stick has no hot cue in that slot yet.
//   - Memory cues have no slot number, so two are treated as "the same"
//     cue if their positions are within PositionToleranceMs of each other;
//     a local memory cue is added only if no existing stick memory cue is
//     that close to it (avoids near-duplicate clutter from cues that are
//     really the same beat, off by a little due to source rounding).
// A candidate is only proposed when merging would actually add at least
// one cue -- a track already carrying everything the backup has to offer
// is left alone.
