# Deploys seabass.exe as a standalone Windows build: runs windeployqt,
# then copies the *full* transitive DLL closure (Qt's own non-Qt deps, the
# mingw-w64 runtime, and every plugin's own dependencies -- notably the
# multimedia backend's FFmpeg codec libraries and the image-format plugins'
# codec libraries, neither of which windeployqt or a shallow one-off DLL list
# can predict). See docs/windows-build.md's "Deploying the GUI" section for
# why this can't just be a fixed list: it must be re-walked after any
# Qt/MSYS2 package update, since the exact set of transitive dependencies
# drifts with upstream package versions.
#
# Usage: run from anywhere, with MSYS2 UCRT64 installed at C:\msys64:
#   .\tools\deploy-windows.ps1 [-BuildDir build-win]
